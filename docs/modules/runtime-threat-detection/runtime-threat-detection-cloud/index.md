## Runtime Threat Detection and CloudTrail

Sysdig's Runtime Threat Detection is not limited to your Linux Kernel Syscalls and Kubernetes Audit trail--it can also do agentless runtime threat detection against AWS CloudTrail (as well as Azure, GCP, Okta, Entra ID and GitHub--with more coming all the time)! 

When we say agentless, we mean that the Falco watching your CloudTrail is run by Sysdig in our SaaS backend for you.
